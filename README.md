This is the instruction kit for making the simplest of LED lights. It all centres around a CREE XLamp® CMU2236 LED. An inexpensive and bright (~5.5Klm) LED. It is powered by USB-c and the 100cm² heatsink means that this (for now) is a silent fanless light. There's lots of room for improvement (tripod mount, active cooling, better enclosure) but we're sharing this because we find it handy for taking photos/video (examples below).
